# Personal Homepage

This is my personal homepage. I adapted it from a [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com) site template which was built using [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org).

## Getting started

First install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` variable to your site's public URL:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://example.com
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Roadmap ðŸš§
